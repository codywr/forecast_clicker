# forecast_clicker

Simple webpage that has a (google) map and some weather stats about the
selected location. Clicking on the map will change the selected location.

This will not do much of anything without inserting a couple of API keys:
* google API key is needed in the forecast_clicker.html file
* openweathermap.org API key is needed in the forecast_clicker.js file

This is the result of a coding assignment with the following instructions:

>Your assignment is to create an app that displays a map.
>
>When you click on the map the application uses the latitude and longitude
>of the location of the mouse click to query a webservice to get local
>weather information and display that information on the page.
>
>You can use the following resources to help you:
>
>  Add map tutorial:
>  https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map
>
>  Current weather:
>  http://openweathermap.org/current
>
>  Jquery ajax:
>  http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
>
>or you can do your own thing and make the app work with other tools, but it
>must run in a browser without the need to download any additional libriaries.
